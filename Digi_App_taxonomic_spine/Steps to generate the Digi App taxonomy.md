# Building the Digi App taxonomy

This documentation will document how the NHMD Vascular Plants + NHMD Entomology taxonomy was created.

### Collecting the sources for this taxonomy
It is vital that the taxonomy is raised from quality sources and that the locally employed taxonomic spine is considered.
The sources chosen were:
- The Herbarium of Danish Vascular Plants
- Plants of the World: derived from World Checklist of Vascular Plants: downloadable at http://sftp.kew.org/pub/data-repositories/WCVP/
- TaxonListAAU.xlsx which lives in N:\SCI-SNM-DigitalCollections\DaSSCo\Digi App\Herbarium taxon spine\Source files
- The GBIF backbone taxonomy https://www.gbif.org/dataset/d7dddbf4-2cf0-4f39-9b2a-bb099caae36c
- The svampe-checklist was sent by Christian Lange N:\SCI-SNM-DigitalCollections\DaSSCo\Digi App\Herbarium taxon spine\Source files

Taxonomy is somewhat international so it makes sense to include sources such as Plants of the World, and the GBIF taxonomy. This resource is compiled of 105 different taxonomic datasets.
Though a wonderful resource it does have taxonomic gaps (algae) and geographic gaps.
Though the above listed sources taken together should cover almost everything in the collections except for the field of geology.

Except for the Herbarium of Danish Vascular Plants and the Fungi checklist the other taxonomic sources can be downloaded from the web.
The GBIF taxonomy does need special treatment due to its size and a few structural problems.
