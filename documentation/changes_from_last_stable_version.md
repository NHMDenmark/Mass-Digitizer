## Two major changes in the Digi App
- 'Multi specimen container' radio buttons were added to differentiate between Single-Specimen-Object, Multi-Object-Specimens, and Multi-Specimen-Objects. <sub>1</sub> The abbreviations MOS and MSO are prepended the unique contained ID to quickly mark those records that are multi-something.
- Alternative NHMA taxonomy was requested where the primary taxonomic identifier is not the Latin name but the NHMA alternative taxonomic ID, as submitted to us in an e-mail containing the spreadsheet "Aarhus_Dk_lepidoptera2013.xlsx".  
Instead of using the taxonomic name field to look up names, a digitizer logged in under NHMA Entomology will be presented with a new field "Taxonomic ID" where the alternative taxonomic identifier can be inputted. A valid ID will populate the Taxonomic name field with the coresponding taxonomic name from the app taxonomic table.

<sub>1</sub> 
SSO= A single specimen in/on one container  
MOS = One specimen taking up several containers
MSO = One container containing multiple specimens
