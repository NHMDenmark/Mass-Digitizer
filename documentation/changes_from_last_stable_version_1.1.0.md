## Two major changes in the Digi App
- 'Multi specimen container' radio buttons were added in version 1.1.0 to differentiate between Single-Specimen-Object, Multi-Object-Specimens, and Multi-Specimen-Objects. <sup>1</sup> The abbreviations MOS and MSO are prepended to the unique contained ID to quickly mark those records that are multi-something.
The change here is that the radio buttons are updated to produce events rather than to be one of three states in the app. The radio button actions are required to change the status which makes selecting MSO or MOS a more involved process as has been requested.

<sup>1</sup> 
SSO= A single specimen in/on one container  
MOS = One specimen taking up several containers  
MSO = One container containing multiple specimens
