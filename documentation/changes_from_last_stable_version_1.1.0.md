## Significant change in the Digi App
An alternative NHMA taxonomy was specified where the primary taxonomic identifier is not the Latin name but the NHMA alternative taxonomic ID (integer numbers so far), as submitted to us in an e-mail containing the published taxonomy "Karsholt, O., & Stadel Nielsen, P. (2013). Revideret fortegnelse over Danmarks sommerfugle. Lepidopterologisk Forening, KÃ¸benhavn."  
Instead of using the taxonomic name field to look up names, a digitizer logged in under NHMA Entomology will be presented with a new field "Taxonomic ID" where the alternative taxonomic identifier can be inputted. A valid ID will populate the Taxonomic name field with the corresponding taxonomic name from the app taxonomic table.
