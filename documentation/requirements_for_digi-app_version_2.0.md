# Digi app 2.0 requirements

- Must be able to run off line
- Must be suitable for packaging into an executable, so that clients are not forced to install Python and sundry stuff.
- Must be able to work with keyCloak
- Easy integration with a DB (currently SQLite)
- Required to be 'fast enough'. This is likely to rest mainly on the autosuggest implementation.
- Must be packagable so that it runs independently of Python.
