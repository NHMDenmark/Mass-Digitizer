The GitHub repository is not the place for sharing transient files. All files not directly contributing to the code base are added to our Google Drive folder at DigitalCollections/DaSSCo/Development/File Sharing

With regards to taxonomy: The aim should be to directly update and improve the Taxon Spine in the local database file of the application (MassDigitizer/db/db.sqlite3)
